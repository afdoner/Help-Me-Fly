# Help Me Fly

Predicting best airline experience through data analysis with Python. We are looking to compare three airlines - American, Delta, and United. Data cleaning, basic descriptive analytics, visualizations, PCA, Bayes Model for predicting, and test/train methods are used. The dataset includes a binary variable "Recommended" which is the subject of prediction.

## Getting Started

There are two options for exploring this project.

1. Visit the following link for viewing only: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/afdoner/Help-Me-Fly/blob/master/Help-Me-Fly.ipynb.

OR

2. Download the Jupyter Notebook found at: https://github.com/afdoner/Help-Me-Fly/blob/master/Doner_Midterm_Exam.ipynb
   for viewing and executing the code.

### Prerequisites

Jupyter Notebook is required if you chose option #2 to view and execute the code. An additional prerequisite is Anaconda. You can find the download links here:

Anaconda - https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

Jupyter - https://jupyter.org/install

After launching Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the downloaded file and open it to begin exploring the code.

## Additional Notes

If you have not, you will likely need to download some additional plugins for Jupyter when executing the code. The following were used in this notebook:

- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- numpy
